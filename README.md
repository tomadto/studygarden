# Study Garden

## What is Study Garden?

Study Garden is a website that encourages students to study more effectively by allowing them to keep track of their study sessions in the form of flowers that grow as they study. It takes a nontrivial time for both your comprehension of a topic to advance and for a plant to mature, so why not tie the two together? Choose between a variety of flowers to grow, and start studying!
